# typeSelector SPA

Super simple typeface selection page for use with graphic design clients. Often it's simpler to present clients with the visual experience of seeing the faces than trying to explain the design intention behind them and iterate proofs. I wanted to build a simple one-pager that could quickly do this for any importable typeface.

Next iteration will include more google typeface options and a cleaner interface. Also need to rebuild it for responsive design and include accessibility standards (this was a very early web dev project before I learned better =)

Future updates:

- Needs responsive layout
- Needs accessibility updates
- Light mode switch for the insane
- Type category selection by standard styles (sans, serif, oblique, gothic, humanist, transitional, etc)
- Type relative selection by tags (quirky, formal, read easy, display, painterly, etc)
- Split screen comparison of different faces
- Suggestions examples of nice pairings
- SEO update, for practice more than anything.

Alrighty, updated for the next time I engage with this one. Big hugs future me and anyone else reading this. Cheers!
